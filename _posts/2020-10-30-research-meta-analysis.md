## 1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
null: The elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to total expenditure is 0.3-0.5.
alternative: The elasticity of calorie consumption with respect to total expenditure is not 0.3-0.5.

## 2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?


The data has been analyzed and retrieved by:
Shankar Subramanian
  Cornell University and Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research
Angus Deaton
  Princeton University

## 3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?
The Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation in India does some thing called the National Sample Survey. The data was originally collected by that ministry. 

## 4. Why are they interested in this data?
The authors write, "Counting the cost of calories is also relevant for evaluating explanations of unemployment based on efficiency wage." They also examine how substitution enhancing can increase the purchasing power of welfare in low-income areas. This could allow for various methods of economic implementation of markets to prop up certain low-income areas. 

## 5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
This sample consists of 5,630 households, 10 in each of 563 villages. Respondants of the survey were asked what they ate, how much they ate, and how much they spent over the past 30 days. The number of "meals" given at events was also recorded. More variables include, "landownership; the age, sex, marital status, and educational level of family members; the occupation of the household head; the household's religion and caste; and indicators of wealth, such as house area, type of construction, state of repair, and access to piped drinking water and electricity."

The caste system in India is still very prevalent, so its social/economic effects should also be included as a metric for this study. This study has not considered it.

## 6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
They have mainly used other research papers that have explored the same subject in India and other countries as benchmarks for their conclusions. While the data showed significance, they re-affirmed this significance with pieces of these other research papers

## 7. How was this study funded?
This information is not publicly available. However, one of the authors, Shankar Subramanium was from the Indira Ghandi Institute of Development Research, so it is possible that that the institute funded this research.

## 8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?
A large part of the evidence for these conclusions was other studies which validates this study significantly. This journal article was also found through the JSTOR database which is one of the most reputable in the world, and the journal itself is a peer-review journal(at least currently). I do not believe that this effect came into play on this study, but there is a chance. Also, with the phenomenon of taking data in a poor country, it could be easier to pick and choose/manipulate data, so it fits their hypotheses.
